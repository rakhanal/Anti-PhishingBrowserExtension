 Anti-Phishing Browser Extension

A browser extension that detects phishing URLs using a Flask API backend. 
Developed as part of my Capstone Project for my Bachelor of Information Technology (Cybersecurity).

 Features
- Detects phishing vs safe URLs
- Sends URL to Flask API for analysis
- Displays clear results to the user
- Uses ML/feature-extraction backend

 Technologies Used
- JavaScript (browser extension front-end)
- Python + Flask (API backend)
- Machine Learning (feature extraction)
- Dataset: phishing and legitimate URLs 

 How It Works
1. User clicks the extension  
2. URL is captured and sent to Flask API  
3. API processes the URL and returns result  
4. Extension displays "Phishing" or "Safe"
